`mine_data_structs` is just a crate containing data structs for `uranium-rs`. 

This crate was made by myself for **myself**, I don't care if it is useless to you,
I don't care if it doesn't follow certain patterns, indeed, I just care about it working
for me.

If you find this crate usefull in anyways you should reconsider many things in your
project.

There is no documentation because ChatGPT is not working, and I'm not gonna write
docs for 5h1tty JSON. 


Thanks, my best regards. <3
